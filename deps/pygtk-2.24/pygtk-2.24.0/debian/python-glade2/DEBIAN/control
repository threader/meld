Description: GTK+ bindings: Glade support
 Contains bindings for the glade library from use within Python. Glade
 makes it very easy to create a user interface. In the target
 application you just need to load the interface description from
 the .glade file instead of constructing the GUI at runtime.
 .
 This package is deprecated, you should migrate to using
 gobject-introspection (GIR) based python bindings instead (PyGObject).
