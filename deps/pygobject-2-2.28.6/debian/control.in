Description: deprecated static Python bindings for the GObject library
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the static Python bindings for gobject, glib, and gio.
 These are deprecated by dynamic gobject-introspection bindings (which are
 provided with the python-gobject package), and should not be used in newly
 written code. These static bindings just exist to provide backwards
 compatibility for GNOME 2 based software.

Description: development headers for the static GObject Python bindings
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the development headers needed to build
 static Python bindings relying on pygobject. Note that this is obsolete, new
 libraries and applications should use the dynamic gobject-introspection
 bindings (which are provided with the python-gobject package).

Description: deprecated static Python bindings for the GObject library (debug extension)
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the static Python bindings for gobject, glib, and gio.
 These are deprecated by dynamic gobject-introspection bindings (which are
 provided with the python-gobject package), and should not be used in newly
 written code. These static bindings just exist to provide backwards
 compatibility for GNOME 2 based software.
 .
 This package contains the extensions built for the Python debug interpreter.
