pygobject-2 (2.28.6-5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Split package: The 2.28 version is now deprecated and called pygobject-2;
    it will only contain the old static bindings without introspection.  The
    pygobject 3.0 version only contains the introspection bindings now, and
    will depend on python-gobject-2 for backwards compatibility until all
    packages get ported to use introspection.
    - debian/control.in, debian/rules: Rename packages to *-2 and update
      description to point out that these are deprecated and only provided for
      backwards compatibility.
    - debian/control.in, debian/rules: Drop python 3 packages; python3-gobject
      does not yet have any reverse dependencies, and we don't want to
      encourage porting to Python 3 without porting to GI as well.
    - debian/control.in: Update Vcs-* for pygobject-2 branch.
    - debian/rules: Disable introspection support. Drop gobject-introspection
      and libgirepository1.0-dev build dependencies.

    - 00git_messagebox_type.patch: Fix MessageBox so it correctly handles
      the type constructor param.
    - 00git_python3_build.patch, 00git_python3-maketrans.patch: Python 3 fixes.
    - 00git_gio_test.patch: Port test_properties from static gio to GI Gio, so
      that the tests will also work with Python 3.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Add and build python3-gobject and
    python3-gobject-dbg packages. Until we get py3cairo packaged in Debian (in
    the works), we need to build the python3 flavour with --disable-cairo, and
    apply some workarounds in debian/rules (see the "FIXME"s); these will
    disappear again with py3cairo.

  * debian/rules: Move from pysupport (which is being deprecated) to

    (Closes: #614764)
  * debian/rules: Install a library search path for a pysupport compatible
    gtk-2.0 directory, to avoid instantly breaking all reverse dependencies.
    This needs to stay until they get converted to dh_python2.
  * Fix test suite calls during package build (Closes: #619257):
    - debian/rules: Copy Python files from our modules into build tree, so
      that the tests actually find them. In Python you can't have Python
      modules and compiled extensions which belong to the same import in
      different directories. (Unfortunately it's hard to upstream this, so
      keep it as a Debian specific hack for now.)
    - debian/rules: Run the tests under xvfb so that the Gdk/Gtk ones can
      succeed.
    - debian/rules: Disable fakeroot for the tests by unsetting $LD_PRELOAD.
      Otherwise the tests try to connect to root's session D-BUS.
    - debian/control.in: Add build dependencies: xvfb (as we now use it in
      debian/rules), dbus-x11 (as the test suite uses dbus-launch), and
      python-apt-dbg/python-cairo-dbg, so that the test cases for the debug
      builds have all dependencies met.
