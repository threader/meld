 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open
 framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with
 others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
 including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
 sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
 derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
 any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
 license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives.

 accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide,
 royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable
 Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:
 .
 2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally
 distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim,
 unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial
 purposes, provided that in each instance:
 (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright
 and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the
 Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to
 this License; and
 (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of
 Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You
 may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict
 this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under
 Section 6.
 .
 2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display,
 perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
 Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial
 purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these
 conditions:
 (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the
 Source Code of the Covered Code;
 (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in
 Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause
 the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the
 files and the date of any change; and
 (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of
 all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom
 You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source
 Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the
 terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in
 Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or
 twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
 longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally
 Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).
 .
 2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy
 Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable
 form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as
 in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is
 available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to
 obtain such Source Code.
 .
 2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although
 Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of
 the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any
 Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other
 intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor
 disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
 exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole
 responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
 any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to
 distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license
 before distributing the Covered Code.
 .
 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses
 granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity
 receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive,
 royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent
 Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or
 controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense,
 distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and
 extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
 .
 4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with
 other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion
 thereof.
 .
 5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no
 other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.
 Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from
 Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.
 .
 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights
 consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms")
 to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
 own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any
 Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such
 Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify,
 defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of
 any such Additional Terms.
 .
 7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of
 this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
 version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular
 version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that
 version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any
 subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple
 has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under
 this License.
 .
 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part
 pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain
 errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or
 contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the
 Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE
 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF
 ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS
 "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY
 DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
 OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF
 QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH
 CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE
 COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR
 REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
 ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR
 WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED
 REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. You acknowledge
 that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear
 facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control
 machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death,
 personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT
 SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT
 OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER
 UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS
 LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
 THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
 PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT
 APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages
 (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed
 the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
 .
 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
 or trade names "Apple", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming
 Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging
 to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo
 or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple
 Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or
 to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as
 expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's
 third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at
 http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
 .
 11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each
 Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications
 made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and
 to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple
 ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be
 automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion,
 choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different
 terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them
 at all.
 .
 12. Termination.
 .
 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
 terminate:
 (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any
 term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
 becoming aware of such breach;
 (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
 13.5(b); or
 (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the
 term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against
 Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent
 infringement against You in that instance.
 .
 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop
 any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of
 the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly
 granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.
 Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the
 termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to
 Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other
 for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of
 terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
 License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.
 .
 13. Miscellaneous.
 .
 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined
 in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered
 Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined
 in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and
 software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212
 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR
 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in
 Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).
 Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
 those rights set forth herein.
 .
 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating
 an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association
 between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to
 the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.
 .
 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's
 right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or
 distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions
 as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or
 products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.
 .
 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any
 provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of
 that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the
 language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply
 to this License.
 .
 13.5 Severability.
 (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of
 this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the
 License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the
 economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License
 will continue in full force and effect.
 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts
 You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or
 prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
 immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the
 Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or
 control.
 .
 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between
 You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern
 District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal
 jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that
 District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations
 Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
 excluded.
 .
 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire
 agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
 License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of
 California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.
 .

 applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License
