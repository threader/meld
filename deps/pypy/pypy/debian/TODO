* Triage and fix/skip all test failures
* Stop embedding expat strings
* Add a way to disable network tests. ATM they fail silently, so this isn't a big priority
* Look at importing distutils-sysconfig.diff from cpython, if it's needed.
* Forward patches to PyPy upstream:
  - pep3147-*
* Provide an option for i386 machines without SSE2.
  PyPy upstream claims SSE2 is vital for performance and we can't disable it
  for i386, we should provide both SSE2-enabled and legacy binaries.
  The JIT with out SSE2 is currently broken...
* Work out the details for module packages supporting pypy.
* Package rpython
  - Figure out where to put rpython/_cache
  - Stop writing things into rpytohn/translator/c/src
* Porting:
  - _continutation needs a single function ported to each architecture. Mostly
    copy-paste from python-greenlet, but slightly different API.
* Multi-Arch:
  - config cache
  - headers
