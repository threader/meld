Description: fast alternative implementation of Python - PyPy interpreter
 PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language
 (2.7). It has several advantages and distinct features:
  * Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler (on x86), Python programs often
    run faster on PyPy.
  * Memory usage: large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less
    space than they do in CPython.
  * Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing Python code.
    It supports ctypes and can run popular Python libraries like twisted and
    django.
  * Stackless: PyPy supports stackless mode on most platforms, providing
    micro-threads for massive concurrency.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy interpreter.

Description: standard library for PyPy (an alternative Python interpreter)
 The PyPy standard library. This is a combination of modules, copied directly
 from cpython, modified cpython modules, and modules entirely re-implemented
 (usually in pure Python, where they are C extensions in cpython).
